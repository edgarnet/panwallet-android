###monacoin done right

This is the monacoin port of the breadwallet Android app, which can be found [here](https://github.com/breadwallet/breadwallet-android).

#####a completely standalone monacoin wallet:

Unlike many other monacoin wallets, Pan is a real standalone monacoin
client. There is no server to get hacked or go down, so you can always access
your money. Using
[SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Header-Only_Clients)
mode, Pan connects directly to the monacoin network with the fast
performance you need on a mobile device.

#####the next step in wallet security:

Pan is designed to protect you from malware, browser security holes, *even physical theft*. 
With AES hardware encryption, app sandboxing, and verified boot, Pan represents a significant 
security advance over web and desktop wallets.

#####beautiful simplicity:

Simplicity is Pan's core design principle. A simple backup phrase is
all you need to restore your wallet on another device if yours is ever lost or broken.
Because Pan is [deterministic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki),
your balance and transaction history can be recovered from just your backup phrase.
